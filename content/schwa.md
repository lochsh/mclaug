Title: "The most common vowel in English"?
Slug: schwa
Date: 20th October 2025

## <span class=ipa>[hʉz̥ ɪ̞̠̃ŋgɫɪ̞̠ʃ]</span>?

Popular factoids about the English language often leave me feeling contrarian,
as a native speaker of a variety of English often not included in these
broad, unqualified statements. "English has no second person plural"? What do
[yous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Second-person_plural_pronouns_in_English){:target=”_blank”} mean? And the
[seemingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu4zyRqILYM){:target=”_blank”} ever
[popular](https://xkcd.com/2907/){:target="_blank"}: "schwa is the most common vowel in English".

This last statement has often left me puzzled, as I've never been able to
confidently perceive this sound in my own speech. Is this a lack of skill, a
misunderstanding, or is my phonemic intuition pointing at some truth about my
English that can make me feel superiorly contrarian once again?

## My English

In the Tom Scott [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu4zyRqILYM){:target=”_blank”} linked above (which you should watch if you don't know
what "schwa" is) he says to the viewer "[when you name the
letter "a"] you're actually
making two separate vowel sounds, <span
class=ipa>/eɪ/</span>". A bold statement, because I say it with a monophthong:
<span class=ipa>/e/</span>.

Compare a Southern Standard British English
[recording](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/face_n?tl=true&tab=pronunciation){:target="_blank"} of "face" <span
class=ipa>[fɛjs]</span>[^1]:

to me saying "face" <span class=ipa>[fes]</span>:

<video width=100% controls>
  <source src="/images/analysing-my-own-speech/face.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

They sound quite different[^2], and you can see in the spectrogram (which shows
frequency content over time) that the formants (the most prominent frequencies)
of the SSBE vowel vary, but are very steady in mine:

So where do you think I'm from? If you know much about accents of English then
there are only a few options based on my pronunciation of "face" and my being a
native speaker, and I don't think my being disgruntled by an English person
incorrectly telling me how I speak does much to narrow it down. Here's a bit
more of my speech, taken from my reading of ["Comma Gets a
Cure"](https://www.dialectsarchive.com/comma-gets-a-cure){:target=”_blank”}, before I tell you
more:

"that itchy goose" <span class=ipa>[ðaʔ ɪ̞̠t͡ʃe gʉs]</span>

more spontaneous speech:

That's right, I'm Scottish! But despite this being a post about my speech, I'm
not going to share too many more clips, because I am shy, and because I don't
want you to make a clone of my voice.

Here are some known and possible influences on my
speech:

* I grew up in Edinburgh in the east of Scotland.

* I was raised by my parents who are both from Clydebank in the west of
  Scotland.

* I went to university in Cambridge in England 2010-2014, living there about
  half the year.

* I lived in Cambridge full-time 2014-2019.

* I have lived in Oxford since 2019.

* My partner is English, from Surrey.

* My maternal grandmother was from Donegal in Ireland, as were my maternal
  grandfather's parents. I spent most summers in Donegal as a child.

* I was born in the early 1990s.

Any city has a wide range of speech, and I wouldn't say my speech is
representative, but I would say it's not atypical of where I'm from[^3]. I
think living in England has undoubtedly changed my accent, which makes me sad,
but it's still distinctively Scottish. I think any Irish influence is not
phonetic, but shows up in some turns of phrase and syntax, like use of
Hiberno-English "would"[^4] and "so"[^5]. This is the main influence on
my mother's speech also, though she also makes pulmonic ingressive sounds
like the inhaled "yeah"s
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71Ziqdt52Eo){:target="_blank"}.

## Common transcriptions of schwa <span class=ipa>/ə/</span>

There are a few places where SSBE and many American accents[^6] have schwa.
Making reference to Wells' [lexical
sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_set){:target="_blank"}:

* COMMA: words that end with an open syllable (i.e. with a vowel) are
  transcribed as ending in schwa in both
  [SSBE](http://seas3.elte.hu/cube/index.pl?s=comma){:target="_blank"} and in
  [General American](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comma){:target="_blank"}, e.g.
  <span class=ipa>/kɔmə/</span> (SSBE) and <span class=ipa>/kɑmə/</span> (Am)

* NURSE: stressed syllables with Middle English <span class=ipa>/i/, /ɛ/,
  /u/</span> followed by <span class=ipa>/r/</span>. E.g. <span
  class=ipa>/nəːs/</span> (SSBE) and <span class=ipa>/nərs/</span> (Am).

* In [weak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaXYas58_kc){:target="_blank"} (unstressed) forms of
  certain common single syllable words like "the", "a", "at".

* In many unstressed syllables, for example in these SSBE
  transcriptions[^7]: "villain" <span class=ipa>/vɪlən/</span>; "patent" <span
  class=ipa>/patənt/</span>; "synthesis" <span class=ipa>/sɪnθəsɪs/</span>.

* Some accents of English (including many Americans, and perhaps
  increasingly speakers whose speech could be described as SSBE) use schwa in
  even more unstressed syllables where older southern English accents would
  have <span class=ipa>/ɪ/</span>, for example "private" as <span
  class=ipa>/praɪvət/</span>

* Some accents of English (including many
  [Americans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt66Je3o0Qg){:target="_blank"}, but also some
  northwest English and Welsh accents) use schwa for the STRUT lexical set
  (e.g. "gun", "love", "much" "blood").

So what about my English? Intuitively I can say:

* My COMMA vowel is far too open to be schwa

* Like all Scottish people I know, the NURSE vowels didn't all
  [merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_vowel_changes_before_historic_/r/#Nurse_mergers){:target="_blank"}
  for me. I think everyone I know (biased to the central belt[^8]) has <span
  class=ipa>/fʌr/</span>[^9] for "fir" and "fur". I say <span
  class=ipa>/fɛrn/</span> for "fern", often realised <span
  class=ipa>[fɛɾɪ̆n]</span>. Similarly I say "world" as <span
  class=ipa>[wʌɾʌ̆ɫd]</span>[^10].

* I'm less sure about the remaining examples, but some of them I would
  identify with my KIT vowel rather than schwa.

I did some crude formant analysis[^11] comparing my vowels in the KIT, STRUT, and
COMMA lexical sets, and weak forms of non-content words.

![kit-strut-comma](/images/analysing-my-own-speech/kit-strut-comma.svg)
![weak-forms](/images/analysing-my-own-speech/weak-forms.svg)

What I'm taking from this:

* My commA vowel is equivalent to my STRUT vowel
* My KIT vowel is used in weak forms of non-content words

What about unstressed syllables in words like "villain" and "synthesis"? The
[passage](https://www.dialectsarchive.com/comma-gets-a-cure){:target="_blank"}I used for most of
my analysis had very few incidences of these syllables[^12], so I recorded
myself saying individual words[^13]. There they are for your enjoyment and
analysis:

<audio controls>
  <source src="/images/analysing-my-own-speech/schwa.wav" type="audio/wav">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

These words, along with "woman" (from my passage reading), are plotted here
against my KIT and STRUT vowels:

![kit-strut-schwa](/images/analysing-my-own-speech/schwa.svg)

At last! A distinct schwa vowel. So it does exist! The outlier among the KIT
vowels is "woman" which I pronounce with <span class=ipa>/ɪ/</span>. In fact,
many of the KIT examples I used were unstressed and would have been schwa in an
accent with a complete [weak vowel
merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English_close_front_vowels#Weak_vowel_merger){:target="_blank"}.
<small><small>But I'm not going to redo the analysis, I feel like it doesn't
materially affect it.</small></small>

With weak forms:

![kit-strut-schwa-weak](/images/analysing-my-own-speech/schwa-vs-weak.svg)

And with COMMA:

![kit-strut-comma-schwa](/images/analysing-my-own-speech/kit-strut-comma-schwa.svg)

So in summary:

* My STRUT vowel is distinct from schwa

* My COMMA vowel is equivalent to my STRUT vowel, though perhaps sometimes goes
  more central towards schwa

* My KIT vowel is used in weak forms of non-content words

* I have an incomplete weak vowel merger, where some unstressed syllables that
  might be pronounced <span class=ipa>/ɪ/</span> are instead <span class=ipa>/ə/</span>

So, is schwa the most common vowel in my English? It certainly doesn't seem
like it.  In my reading of ["Comma Gets a
Cure"](https://www.dialectsarchive.com/comma-gets-a-cure){:target="_blank"}, I think the only
word I use a schwa in is in the second syllable of "millionaire". (See this
footnote[^12].) One incidence in the entire passage doesn't sound like much to
me! I think my having schwa only in some places in one of the many categories
of syllables where schwa is usually pronounced results in this relatively rare
incidence. Perhaps <span class=ipa>/ɪ/</span> is my most common vowel, on
account of my using it for weak forms.

Superior contrarian feeling achieved 😌.

--------------------

## Appendix A: How mid-central is the vowel I've labelled "schwa"?

Something I haven't pointed out elsewhere in this post is that phonetic symbols
and names like "schwa" have somewhat ambiguous and highly contextual meanings.

Take my KIT vowel, for example. I've seen [vowel
diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_English#/media/File:Scottish_English_monophthongs_chart.svg){:target="_blank"}
for Scottish English that put the KIT vowel much closer to schwa than the IPA
chart shows <span class=ipa>[ɪ]</span>. Similarly
[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation#/media/File:Modern_General_British_monophthong_chart.svg){:target=”_blank”}
"modern RP" vowel chart has a slightly lowered vowel.

Here they are superimposed, with the IPA's reference vowels shown in pink:

![I-vowel-comparison](/images/analysing-my-own-speech/I-vowel-comparison.svg)

I'm not sure if this is an accurate plot of where my KIT vowel is, but it seems
plausible.

There's an implicit assumption in my blog post that this difference between the
IPA's definition of <span class=ipa>[ɪ]</span> and my realisation of <span
class=ipa>/ɪ/</span> is irrelevant to our discussions.

In a similar vein, when people repeat the meme of "schwa is the most common
vowel in English", it can be unclear exactly what vowel they mean, and whether
they are even aware of what they mean[^14]. Do they mean any unstressed reduced
vowel in their English? Specifically something in the near vicinity of the
mid-central vowel on the IPA chart? Or just any sound they've seen transcribed
as <span class=ipa>/ə/</span>?

Anyway, here is me attempting a perfectly mid-central unrounded vowel, followed by my
KIT vowel:

<video width=100% controls>
  <source src="/images/analysing-my-own-speech/schwa-vs-I.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Formant analysis shows <span class=ipa>/ɪ/</span> with a slightly higher F1 and
a more noticeably higher F2. This would make sense, as it would suggest a
slightly less open, and noticeably more fronted vowel.

But how do the formants for my "perfect" mid-central vowel compare to the ones
analysed in my speech?

![perfect](/images/analysing-my-own-speech/perfect.svg)

Lol! It's hard to know if this is because my attempt at a phonetically perfect
mid-central vowel was poor, or because the vowels I labelled schwa live
somewhere else on the vowel chart. Regardless, using <span class=ipa>/ə/</span>
to transcribe them is in keeping with tradition, particularly as they seem to
contrast with my KIT vowel (which if it was my only mid-central vowel, you
could argue would be sensibly transcribed as <span class=ipa>/ə/</span>).

## Appendix B: But what about, eeh, what's it called, "the hesitation vowel"?

Schwa is also sometimes called "the hesitation vowel", the vowel that English
speakers use when they're trying to figure out what to say next. But I think I generally use my DRESS (or maybe FACE?) vowel if I'm
going to make a vocalic hesitation noise while speaking, or maybe STRUT. Here
are some examples taken from voice notes I sent friends:

<span class=ipa>/ɛ/</span>

I think there's an idea that because the tongue position for schwa is
"neutral", i.e. the tongue is at the mid-point of both the open-closed and
front-back axes, that it's natural for speakers to default to it when
reaching for what to say next.

I think what's natural is of course dependent on your native language(s). Take
a look at these vowel diagrams for
[Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Arabic_phonology#/media/File:Arabic_vowels_(Monophthongs).png){:target="_blank"}
(three vowels),
[Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#/media/File:Japanese_vowel_chart_II.svg){:target="_blank"} (five vowels), and
[Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_phonology#/media/File:Italian_vowel_chart.svg){:target="_blank"}
(seven vowels)[^15].

None of these show a schwa vowel. In Japanese it's most common to hear
ええっと<span class=ipa>[e̞ːt̚to̞]</span>[^16]. The two vowels used there are both
central, though they are front and back, respectively. My hesitation vowel is
also mid. Is there something cross-linguistic at play here?

A brief look at this [Reddit
thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/mbvn63/are_hesitation_noises_different_in_various/){:target="_blank"}
suggests some variation, but a lot of languages are listed as having mid vowel
sounds, if I'm interpreting the crude transcription correctly: German, Kyrgyz,
Finnish, Spanish. Notable exceptions appear to be Mandarin, Korean and
Polish. This is quite a crude source of information however.

I love learning about phonetics and phonology: I love learning how speech
sounds are made, about differences and similarities between the sounds of
different languages, and how some differences in speech are immediately
perceptible depending on context and your native language, and others are much
harder to perceive.

I haven't posted on my blog in a while, and none of my previous posts have
reflected this interest. I have a few fun ideas for projects and blog posts
around these topics. Some of them are cross-language, some are specific to the
second languages I am learning: Irish Gaelic and Japanese.

This post was my first try at posting about phonetics. If this is something you have expertise in, and you have any
thoughts on my analysis, please do e-mail me at <a href="mailto:h@mcla.ug">h@mcla.ug</a>! I am not an expert and am very keen to
learn.

[^1]: If you're interested in why I've used a different transcription to Tom
Scott for the SSBE pronunciation of "face", I recommend this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtnlGH055TA) from Geoff Lindsey

[^2]: Mine is also shorter mostly because it is clipped from a longer
utterance, whereas the SSBE recording is from a dictionary where the speaker
has uttered a single word.

[^3]: Apart from my pronuncation of words like "stair" with <span
class=ipa>/ɛ/</span> instead of <span class=ipa>/e/</span>. Compare my
pronunciation of Sarah Perry <span class=ipa>[sɛɾʌ pʰɛɾe]</span>:</br>

In Wells' "Accents of English" he says: "There are some Scots who have <span
class=ipa>/ɛr/</span> rather than <span class=ipa>/er/</span> in SQUARE: they
will say <i>upst[ɛː]rs</i>, not <i>upst[eː]rs</i>. I have heard the claim that
this pronuncation is used only by Roman Catholics in the Glasgow conurbation,
and that it is due to Irish influence. I am not in a position to
substantiate or disconfirm this claim." My mother is indeed from Glasgow and we
are indeed Fenians.

[^4]: Example: "I'd be a fan of that now" instead of "I am a fan". Or "she
wouldn't be rich" instead of "she isn't rich". This feels natural to me, and I
think I use it to indicate a certain subjectiveness or personal perspective. I
do come across more objective usages that are less natural to me. Recently my
cousin asked me "would you wear make-up". For the same meaning I would have
said "do you wear make-up". So I wouldn't say I use it as broadly as people in
Ireland.

[^5]: Example: "I'll go do that then so", not really sure what meaning the
"so" adds but I think I say this all the time. Looking this up, it seems it's
common in Ireland to replace "then" with "so" in such phrases, so perhaps I'm
doubling up! But this is what I say. I also say "ok so" but don't think I
really say "ok then".

[^6]: I don't know enough about American English accents to go into much detail
about cultural and geographical factors that might affect the usage of schwa,
despite being constantly subjected to American voices by media that I
choose to consume of my own volition. I'm sorry if you are American and what I
write here does not represent your accent. I have tried to make it clear that I
am talking about _some_ American accents and talking in broad terms of what
dictionaries often transcribe things as.

[^7]: Taken from the [CUBE dictionary](http://seas3.elte.hu/cube)

[^8]: I have read speakers from other areas have <span class=ipa>/fɪr/</span>
for "fir". It's not like I've never met or heard anyone from outside the
central belt! But not since I gained the sort of phonetic awareness that might
cause me to notice this difference in pronunciation.

[^9]: My STRUT vowel has definitely changed a bit from living in England. When
I am chatting to my Scottish pals or speaking loudly (e.g. over a noisy pub),
my vowel changes to (I think) further back and more open.

[^10]: I haven't included any formant analysis for this set. It's harder to
segment the vowels next to approximants, and I think some of my realisations
are r-coloured vowels, which skews the F3 formant in a way that I think is
distracting.

[^11]: I manually segmented the vowels and used the default formant analysis in
Praat's vocal toolkit. I visually inspected the spectrograms to ensure the
formants looked sensible. Most of the tokens are from my reading of
["Comma Gets a Cure"](https://www.dialectsarchive.com/comma-gets-a-cure). I
conceived the vowel distance plots myself from my understanding that relative
difference between formants was most important for perception, so if you're a
linguist and have thoughts on their usefulness I'd be grateful. I think they
match what is done in the Bark Difference metric described
[here](https://lingtools.uoregon.edu/norm/norm1_methods.php), without
cross-speaker normalisation (as it's just me speaking).

[^12]: The words I picked out were: "woman" (two incidences, one of which had
indistinct formants), "millionaire" (indistinct formants, perhaps due
to pharyngealised /l/), "beautiful" (I have no intervening vowel between /f/
and /l/), "suffering" (I have no intervening vowel between /f/ and /r/). So
only one usable token. In retrospect words like "private" could also have been
used here, but as the CUBE dictionary transcribes it <span
class=ipa>prɑjvɪt</span> I had some impression that there was a difference
between this and the other words. But I think it's just reflecting an
incomplete weak vowel merger. I also use <span class=ipa>/ɪ/</span> in
"private".

[^13]: This is less desirable as there's always a chance I might
self-consciously pronounce the words differently than normal, or just stating
them in isolation might be different from saying them in connected speech. But
I think the recording sounds very normal to me.

[^14]: There are many linguists I respect, like Geoff Lindsey, who have said
schwa is the most common vowel in English. I am not questioning whether he
knows what he's talking about, more pointing out how much of a meme the "fact"
has become, hence it is repeated without necessarily being understood.

[^15]: All of these languages have "non-standard" varieties, where I'm sure the
vowels vary significantly. Certainly there are varieties of Japanese with
[more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya_dialect) or
 [less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Izu_Archipelago_dialects)
vowels than shown here. My knowledge of Arabic and Italian is much less.

[^16]: Japanese has a lot of "filler"
[words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizuchi) that are quite
important parts of holding a conversation. I feel like ええっと or ええと or
えっと is the best analogy for the places I would usually hestitate and go
"eee" or "eem". One of the Reddit comments on the linked thread is about
Japanese and lists some of these but I feel like only あの and ええと are used
for unconscious hesitation, and the others are more expressive of specific
sentiments. I would use あの more if I was shyly interrupting or about to say
something I felt shy about, and えっと for stalling while I think of the next
word to say. I am not a native speaker, however.
