Title: About

Hello

<big><big>I'm Hannah ・ハナといいます・Nóra atá orm</big></big>

I'm an engineer living in Oxford, UK, with an amateur interest in linguistics. I
love learning about phonetics and phonology. I'm particularly interested in
Japanese and Gaelic, especially the Gaelic of Donegal.

I have previously worked as a software engineer, writing Rust and Python for
quantum computers, C++ for medical imaging diagnostics, and bare metal embedded
C for surgical robots. I studied Information and Computer Engineering at the
University of Cambridge.
